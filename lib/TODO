TODO LIST: 

add virtual destructor to bc_step class

add check to event_detect to ensure 0 crossing found w/in tolerance

figure out why u2* search is not working in bounce.cpp

make jump_rho in bc_impact_step more general or move to main cpp file

accept projection operator callable in cost.hpp and inc_cost.hpp

better encapsulate impact & event code - bc_impact_step, event_detect/exec

implement pendubot dynamics/linearizations like acrobot

implement Q / P / R matrices as classes so they can be functions of x / u / t

use trep for function derivative evaluations

create continuous control objects

class fb_sys_dynam needs to be better thought out & integrated

nothing stops LQR feedback from being > usat
